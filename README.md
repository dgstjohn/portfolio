## Don St. John's portfolio

A portfolio website that demonstrates Don's web development abilities, with a bio and picture, image examples and links to sites on which he's worked, and contact information.

## Real or Not?

The images of sites for Electronic Entertainment magazine and the Daily Hampshire Gazette newspaper represent sites that Don helped to develop (but that are either defunct now in the case of Electronic Entertainment or where his work has been replaced with the Gazette), while the live University of Massachusetts Medical School site still uses his designs for the homepage and the news site.
